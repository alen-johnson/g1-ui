# Frontend for GI-UI (Social Deduction Game)

This is the frontend for the GI-UI social deduction game, built with React.js. The web app allows players to interact with the game by joining game rooms, viewing player lists, and performing game actions. It communicates with the backend to fetch and update game data, ensuring a smooth user experience. The user interface is styled using a combination of Ant Design components and custom CSS for a modern and responsive design.
